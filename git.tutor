How to list branches that contain a given commit?
  --> git branch --contains <commit> # only local branches
  --> git branch -r --contains <commit>  # across local and remote branches.

List all commits in the current branch that are not in the remote branch.
  --> git cherry -v

For a given file, find what commits were added to master relative to your branch.
  --> git log --oneline HEAD..master -- <file>

Change author:
  --> git commit --amend --author="Author Name <email@address.com>"
